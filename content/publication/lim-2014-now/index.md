abstract = "This research explores the uses of communication channels that couples adopt in varied geographical distance settings. We also characterize their conflict patterns and strategies for resolving the conflicts. We found that the distances between couples have a strong influence on their communication patterns. The distance is associated with typical conflicts pattern that couples confronted as well as the relationship maintenance strategies. In this research, we classify distance settings into four categories. Then, we perform semi-structured interviews with 20 couples in various distance settings. The analysis allows us to develop design guidelines for mitigating conflicts associated with the four distance categories."
